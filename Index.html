		<td valign="top">I'm 27 years old. I live in Utah, United States of America.
		I am working toward a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science.. I currently work for an 
		insurance brokerage in Salt Lake City. I have a wife and a 4-year-old son. Also, 
		I may not appear it, but I absolutely LOVE vitality! It is the 
		greatest wellness program I have ever been a participant of! They 
		tell you how to be healthy and stuff, like if you want to know how 
		many eggs you can have per week and still be healthy. It's 2. 
		More than 2 per day and you are risking making your cholesterol
		high. Bacon is also okay to have as long as it's only every once in a 
		while. This picture is also deceiving because my eyes are actually not blue. 
		They are hazel. I took 2 or 3 years of French in High School, depending on 
		who you ask. Now I know how to order a sandwich in France... Donnez-moi 
		un sandwich, sil vous plait. Merci!</td>
